Xavier’s Christening and Garden Party
=======

Hello!

This is the site with all the details about Xavier’s Christening and the reception afterwards.

Hopefully this answers some of your questions, but if we can help with anything else, please let us know!

## Timing of the day:

- 12:15 Everyone seated in the church at St. Ippolyts
- 12:30 Christening Service starts
- 13:45 Garden reception at Chimneys, Mill Lane
- 15:00 Buffet Lunch served
- 18:30 Carriages


## Dress

Smart-casual / Summer garden-party

## Children

Children are very welcome - please include them on your RSVP. We will make sure there is appropriate food and entertainment for small people at the party. If you need somewhere for toddlers or babies to nap after the service, we can also offer a quiet place in the house.

The christening service will be informal with lots of music. There is a small play area for children in the church, but feel free to come and go in and out of the church as needed.

## Parking

Parking at the church is extremely limited.

We recommend parking on the road near the house in Gosmore (we recommend on Mill Road), and then walking to the church. Allow 20 minutes to walk to the church. There is pavement all the way and a pedestrian crossing across the busy London Road.

Parking in Gosmore is also rather limited - we recommend car sharing where possible, or pooling and taking a taxi together.

## Presents

Xavier is fortunate to have more toys than waking hours to play with them all! So, rather than presents, we’d kindly like to ask you to make a charity donation.

> As we come up to celebrating Xavier’s first birthday, we remember that not every baby makes it so far, therefore we’ve chosen to collect money for Tommys - a charity that funds research into miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. We hope that the money collected can go towards making sure no parent has to go through the pain of losing a baby.


# Information for People Traveling


## Where to stay

- Hitchin is a cute market town with a small river and a large number of coffee shops and restaurants. Whilst it’s not exactly a tourist hub and the town is very charming, but the hotel selection is a bit thin. One option we can recommend is the premier inn (https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/hertfordshire/hitchin/hitchin-town-centre.html) - it’s cheap and functional but right in the centre of town. We spent 3 nights here at Christmas 2021 when Louise’s family had covid, and we can attest that it’s a good value place to stay! (If you’re in Hitchin on Saturday night, please let us know and we will be happy to meet up for dinner)

- Another option is to stay in London. It’s a 30 min train to Hitchin station from where you can get a taxi to st ippolyts (10 mins).

 - We’d recommend staying near to King’s Cross to minimise travel time getting across town. One hotel we really like is the Kimpton Fitzroy (https://www.kimptonfitzroylondon.com), although the selection is pretty endless. A transfer from London to Hitchin is around 65 mins depending on traffic and where you start in London.

Car transfer service we’ve had experience with and were fine (pricing very transparent when you book): https://www.1stairporttaxis.co.uk

## How to get to Hitchin

If you’re flying transatlantic, you’ll most likely be arriving to London Heathrow or Gatwick. Both are well enough connected to Hitchin with public transport if you don’t want to drive.

- Gatwick has a direct train (rides through London) to Hitchin, roughly twice an hour. No changes.

- Heathrow also has a train into central London, where you can change onto the mainline services to Hitchin.

Google maps has all the connections and details. Hitchin town centre is about a 10-15 minute walk from the station - taxis are normally queued up at the station if you have bags and it’s too far to walk.

The church is in St. Ippolyts, a few miles outside of Hitchin. It’s about a 10 minute drive (easy enough to get a taxi in Hitchin) or a 40 minute walk if that’s more your thing.
